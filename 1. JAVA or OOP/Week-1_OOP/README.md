# Java reminders

* Object - Data combined with algorithms for it form Object.
* Interface - Object communicate with each other using their interface (their public methods) in different ways.
* abstract class - you have default and you want to add hook
* interface - you build a slot

## ACCESS MODIFIERS

* private - only within the class.
* public - everyone.
* default, called package private - everyone within the package.
* protected - everyone within the package, and all subclasses (next class).

# OOP Concepts
* Abstraction - display only the important features.
  * data abstraction - data structure aren't important (Student).
  * control abstraction - method implementation aren't important.
* Encapsulation - limit the access using ACCESS MODIFIERS.
* Inheritance - the ability to extend interface.
* Polymorphism - change interface to your own need
  * Static polymorphism - same method name different prototypes.
  * Dynamic polymorphism - when parent class has his son implementation and it override method.
