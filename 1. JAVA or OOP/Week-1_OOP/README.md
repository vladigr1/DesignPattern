# Java reminders

small practice with java before diving in
* abstract class - you have default and you want to add hook
* interface - you build a slot

# OOP Concepts
* Abstraction - only needed info is present.\
  data abstraction - no need to know how data store (Student)\
  control abstraction - difficult method have simple interface.
* Encapsulation - access specifier (private, public)
* Inheritance - the ability to extend interface.
* Polymorphism - change interface to your own need
  Static polymorphism - same method name different prototypes.
  Dynamic polymorphism - when parent class has his son implementation and it override method.
