# Behavior Pattern
behavioral design patterns are design patterns that identify common communication patterns among objects. By doing so, these patterns increase flexibility in carrying out communication. 

Behavioral patterns describe not just patterns of objects
or classes but also the patterns of communication between them. These patterns
characterize complex control flow that's difficult to follow at run-time. They shift your
focus away from flow of control to let you concentrate just on the way objects are
interconnected.
